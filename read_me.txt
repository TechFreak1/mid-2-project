           c99 project.c (It will generate "a.out" file)

To execute

      Example : ./a.out maths_cal

Two Programs under that topic will be displayed and choose the one you want


once the  calculations are performed there will be 3 options
if you want to continue in the same category enter "y"
if you want to change the option enter "c"
if you want to exit  the program enter "n"
Choose accordingly

Limitations
